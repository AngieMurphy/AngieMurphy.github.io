title: OOP Week Eleven
---

## What did you do this past week?
In class this week we talked about the move operator and wrote a move constructor and move assignment for our
vector class. This allowed the user of the vector class to construct or assign a vector using an 'r' value. An 
'r' value is a value which you cannot take the address of, for instance, you cannot say '&4'. 
I thought this week was really interesting and helped reinforce concepts of a copy constructor or copy
assignment constructor, topics which we are familiar with but are still easy to get confused talking about.

I also was able to finish my project early Thursday with my partner. I learned a lot from working with
my partner who had a stronger understanding of few of the topics we've covered in class, such as initializer lists and
overloading operators. What was also good was that I had a chance to implement a few of those things despite
him having a better grasp on them and probably being able to implement them quicker. 

## What's in your way?
PROJECTS. Each week a new project is due. Need to finish graphics this week and try to find time to 
get other work done :-/.

## What will you do next week?
Spend a lot of time on graphics and get started on Wednesday with the Life project, our final
OOP project!

## Tip of the Week
Go vote! :) Just bring your driver's license or other form of acceptable ID to the FAC and get it done!

CS related though, make sure ot take time to relax this last month. I'm so tempted to just stay on campus all
of the time and work but I always work my best when I take things one step at a time and set aside 
time to not think about school at all.
