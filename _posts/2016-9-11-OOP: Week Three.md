title: OOP Week Three - What a week!
---

## What did you do this past week?

This past week was incredibly busy for me. After spending a nice labor day weekend back home, I came back with much to do (finishing the project). I ran into an issue when working on my project related to my compiler not working, and once I started running into those issues I immediately regretted not starting on the project two Mondays ago. Lesson learned though - the project got done but I won't wait that long on future projects again.

In class, we explored pointers in C++. I think I understand pointers one day and then return to the topic the next day and it all seems brand new and confusing. Definitely spending a lot of time practicing those in my spare time.

## What's in your way?

I'm not taking a full semester of classes, but my other CS class, Computer Graphics, is beginning to pick up. This is a project based class, also, and I will need to be really organized in order to balance the work in school along with my job. 

As I mentioned before, I need to read up on and practice writing code with pointers and references. I want to be able to follow along better in class when we are talking about them.

## What will you do next week?

Next week I will focus on both projects I'll have. I'd like to start the next project in OOP no later than Tuesday (after reading it over on Monday). I also want to stay on top of the readings for this class and take some time to practice with pointers. 

My overall experience in the class this week was positive, despite the stress I had outside of it. At times, the pacing can be a bit quick in terms of going over new topics and answering the quiz questions, but at the same time, it is much easier to follow if you've done the related reading. 

## Tip of the Week
So, this isn't a tip for development exactly, but there a few events coming up I'd like fellow game developers and aspiring game developers to know about! For those interested in VR there is the September VR Austin Event sponsored by Oculus!

And if you are 21+, there is an event coming up at Mister Tramps. I attended Austin Game Dev Beer Night last month and it was pretty fun. If you are interested and 21+ I recommend it; it is a great way to connect to fellow game developers in the Austin community!
