title: OOP Week Nine
---

## What did you do this past week?
This week was somewhat relaxing compared to others. I met with my partner for our Allocator project and
we were able to finish the night before it was due. This was so nice! I would like to stay on top of my work like this more often. Next time I finish early though, I'd like to have more of a Piazza presence and help others out. 

In class we built out a class for a vector. We had interesting discussions about ways to build a constructor, and how you can set default values within headers if the user has decided to not define it. Vectors use allocation behind the scenes and we also wrote functions in class for how this allocator would work in the vector class.

## What's in your way?
While last week was slow compared to most, I have an intense two weeks approaching. I have a graphics exam this week, and an oop project due next week,
and a graphics project due the next week! I need to stay focused and I know I can get it all taken care of.

## What will you do next week?
I'll be studying for graphics, a LOT! I also will begin working on my Darwin assignment (message me on Canvas if you're looking for 
a partner and we can compare schedules!). If I have some extra time I will start typing up class examples we wrote in OOP 
to begin studying up. I need to do much better on our last exam than the first. I don't have the best feeling about it, but I think I will be able to recover if I start studying early.

## Tip of the Week
Here's an article about a recent event that happened regarding a cyber attack taking over major websites. (I'm sure many of us have heard about it!)

[The Pirates Who Stole Netflix](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-10-23/the-pirates-who-stole-netflix)

I find it really interesting that this cyber attack was potentially in part created by exploiting the Internet of Things, recruiting smart devices which connect
to the internet.
