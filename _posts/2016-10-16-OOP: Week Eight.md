title: OOP Week Eight
---

## What did you do this past week?
This week I spent a lot of my time working on an OpenGL graphics assignment. In our OOP class, we discussed arrays in C++. I found this 
topic to be really interesting! We learned that built in arrays do not have copy constructors or copy assignment operators. It actually
can be a bit confusing working with arrays in C++ because, unlike Java, you have to consider what you're working with more carefully. Are you
thinking of it as an array or pointer?
We also discussed important considerations when it comes to storing data on the stack or on the heap. I got flashbacks to 
my systems classes and our lectures on garbage collection! Storing on the heap can be tricky, and remembering all that you need
to manage can be difficult.
I also began the Allocator project with my partner. We are doing well and I'm excited about being on top of things for this assignment, 
despite starting later in the week.

## What's in your way?
Honestly, it is the same as last week. I need to stay positive and not get too caught up in grades. I know as long as I try my
best I will succeed in this course and my graphics course, I just get really anxious when I receive grades I'm not proud of, even 
if they aren't that bad.


## What will you do next week?
Finish up the Allocator project, and make sure that we meet all the specs. My partner and I on the Netflix assignment had a few
oversights which affected our grade a bit. I also would like to begin studying for my Graphics exam which is the following week, and 
stay on top of the topics we are reviewing in OOP.
I am also VERY excited about the coming tasks I am taking on at work. I will get to dive into learning about the Frostbite game engine
and learning about how localization works in the game industry.

## Tip of the Week
I learned this past week about 'provisioning profiles' in Apple app development. I learned about this when an iPad app for a side
project I've contributed to was consistently crashing a week after installing it to the device. With some researching, I learned 
that if you don't have a paid Apple Developer account, the app will just not open after about a week, the length of time they give
you when you are issued a 'provisioning profile' at build time of your app. 
Other than this project, I have never deployed anything to iOS so this could be a totally normal, and expected thing that others
experience all of the time, but I didn't learn about this until a few days ago. So, if your app is crashing after a weeks time, this is could be why.
