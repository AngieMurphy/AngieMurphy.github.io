title: OOP Week Four

## What did you do this past week?
This week, we reviewed the new assignment and root mean squared error. 
We had a speaker come in to talk to us about working at Bloomberg. It was nice hearing about their development process and being able to relate that back to what I experience at my current internship. For instance, I am familiar with Jenkins and Jira, so it was cool to hear familiar terms. 
Also in class we discussed more elements of the C++ language. We talked about lists and list iterators using the example of a user defined equals. This was really informative and I am enjoying learning about C++. 

## What's in your way?

For the Netflix project, my partner and I have been wrapping work in other courses so that we can focus on the project a lot this week. While we have a decent start on the assignment, I worry that there are unforeseen issues that could pop up this week in trying to finish it.

## What will you do next week?

Currently running a fever, so I hope to heal up and be there for my partner and my classes! If all goes well, I'll finish both projects for both of my classes, practice with pointers, and stay focused in class, and rest some. 

My overall experience in the course this week was great! It was a relatively calm week compared to the week prior, when I was hurrying to meet the requirements on the first assignment. I feel like my partner and I have a much better grasp on the requirements than I did during the first assignment.

## Tip of the Week
My tip is related to our assignment and what I have found helpful for development in general. It may seem kind of obvious, but, sometimes I need a reminder!
When we (my partner and I) are trying to implement something we are unfamiliar with, for instance, making a makefile from scratch, we take a look at the Collatz (our previous project) makefile and try to fully understand what is going on in that file. I didn't put the 
proper amount of time into doing that when completing the first project, but referring back to code that I know works is really helpful in getting me to understand the 'why's' and 'how's' of the code I need to write. 
Haha, like I said, this is probably a really obvious tip, but it doesn't hurt to be reminded to review what you already know or have worked with to help you make some progress. :)
Another tip that helps me with projects and tasks is to just take daunting objectives one step at a time, which is why I love Github issues or other project management tools (Waffe.io, JIRA, Trello, etc).
