## What did you do this past week?

This week, our class began studying C++ by comparing the language to Java. To reinforce what we have been learning about C++, I put some time into compiling the C++ files we reviewed in class and studied a bit to prepare for our quiz and for the next class. 
Unit testing is going to be important for this class, so we also reviewed some on how that works with an in class example. 
In class, I also introduced myself to a few of my peers thanks to Professor Downing. This is something I'm pretty shy about, so it was nice having the designated time to start those conversations. 

## What's in your way?

I took Data Structures a while back ago and do most of my coding in C#. Occasionally when we were asked as a class how Java did a thing, I blanked! However, I believe I do know enough about Java to grasp the important concepts in how it differs from C++. Ultimately though, I think I will leave this class feeling more comfortable in both languages. 
Even though I have written my tests before for my code, I haven't used a formal unit test system like Google Test before, so there will defintely be learning curve; I don't think it will set me back too much, though.

## What will you do next week?

Next week is diving further into C++ and beginning topics in Object Oriented Programming (based on the readings). My goal is to stay up to date with the readings and come prepared for the quizzes everyday. I also want to make sure I am completely set up for this first assignment with Docker, Github, and Travis CI. I also will try to stay calm! I'm (re)starting an internship this week and want to stay on top of my work so that I can enjoy my work and school experiences.

I've taken a lot from my first week's experience in this course and I think the class is going to be as rewarding as I was anticipating. The lectures are fast paced, but I think I will get the hang of of it. Despite blanking on a question or two about Java, I enjoy using it as a means of comparison for C++. I'm really excited about learning C++. At my job, I started to learn a little bit of it for fun with one of the other interns. It's a language that is used quite often where I work and I think it will be incredibly useful not only from a job standpoint, but also in training me to be a responsible coder. I've heard that C++ is a language that allows you to shoot yourself in the foot, and I may not be saying it later this semester, but that's kind of cool/terrifying to me. :) 

## Tip of the Week
Over the summer a mentor who loves coding in C++ recommended author Scott Meyers. Specifically she recommended _Effective Modern C++_. [Here on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Modern-Specific-Ways-Improve/dp/1491903996/ref=pd_sim_sbs_14_2?ie=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=P1GGYER01448NBGFGA7N). I haven't had the chance to purchase the book, but she swears by it!
