title: OOP Week Ten
---

I cannot believe we are at Week 10!

## What did you do this past week?
We had a really simple week in OOP. Monday was the only day of normal class, where we reviewed our new assignment, Darwin. My partner and I started
on Wednesday and it is bringing some interesting challenges to the table. From afar, creating the Darwin game seems straightforward,
create a few classes, defining their functions, and it all should work, right? There is a catch though - no getters and setters.
This is key to good object oriented design, and yet, it is still quite challenging to build classes which will interact with each
other and (ideally) no nothing about each other. I'm enjoying the learning experience though, honestly. I like to code, but I am extremely
interested in learning about good design.

On Wednesday we had speakers from Pariveda come in to discuss their company and the software develoment cycle.
We had Friday off to go to the 50th anniversary event at the GDC. Unfortunately I had missed the beginning of the only talk I could go to,
being that I needed to rush to work after class normally ends. 

## What's in your way?
There is no relaxing just yet. A bit of work needs to be done before I can feel comfortable with my performance in my classes.
I have a project due this week and next week, a paper to write by this Tuesday, and plenty of studying to do for OOP so
I don't make the same mistakes I did on the last exam.

## What will you do next week?
Finishing up the OOP project, working hard on my Graphics project, writing that essay, and if there is any free time, I'd like
to dedicate an extra 3 hours or so this week and the weeks following to studying OOP. My performance on the last exam was kind of lame, which I anticipated after
taking it. The exam was fair and I expect the next one to be also, so I need to make sure I come better equipped for our last test. 


## Tip of the Week
Holiday season is coming up. I'm thinking about getting some books for my younger cousins, and there is a lot of hype surrounding
this one book, _Ada Twist, Scientist_. Andrea Beaty writes some cool children's books about children exploring their interests, often
in fields like science or engineering. Another one which sounds great is _Rosie Revere, Engineer_. When I was younger, I didn't see many books like this too often, where females
were interested in STEM, so I think these are awesome! Ha, I'll probably
get one for myself and my younger cousins.
