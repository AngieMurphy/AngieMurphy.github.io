title: OOP Week Seven
---

## What did you do this past week?
This past week was tough! This week we discussed defining begin() and end() inside of Range, nested classes, and pointers declared with const.
We also had an exam this week! There were two questions that I personally was disappointed in how I answered them. I wish I had studied what went behind
those two questions more before this past Thursday. Exams really stress me out, and I tend to blank when I get in front them, although I think the mistakes I made
on this last exam were preventable with maybe just two more hours of coding what we reviewed with iterators the past week.

## What's in your way?
Staying motivated and positive about the outcome of the exam and the remaining of the semester. I'm really hard on myself and I need to make sure it doesn't distract me from the work I need to do this week. 

## What will you do next week?
Next week I will complete my next graphics project, which is working with OpenGL and contructing a menger cube. I also would like to begin working on my
OOP project early in the week. 

## Tip of the Week
As I mentioned earlier, coming out of an exam week I have a hard time staying upbeat if I feel like I bombed a question or just 
didn't perform as I wanted. Here is a great, uplifting story about Sofia Tomov, a 12 year old who developed an algorithm to help doctors prescribe drugs to their patients. 
Most of what I work on and code for are games and I love to hear stories like this because they are so out of my element.
I hope it motivates you all as much as it does me.
