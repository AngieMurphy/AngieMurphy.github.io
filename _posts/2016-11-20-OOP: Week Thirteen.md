title: OOP Week Thirteen
---
My last crazy week in college... I hope.

## What did you do this past week?
This past week was the most stress inducing week of the semester. My partner and I got our assignment submitted on time, barely! 
Unfortuantely though, my UML didn't save on my profile and we lost it right before submission. :( So stressful. In addition to
that, I had to put a lot of work into my graphics assignment. Little progress was made, but I do feel like I learned from
this past project.

In class, we discussed inheritance, the clone method, and abstract classes. Abstract classes are syntactically a bit different in C++
than in Java. In order to make a class abstract, the method signature must contain ' = 0;' at the end of the line. We also discussed
when virtual is not dynamically bound.

## What's in your way?
For the first time in awhile, nothing. I feel like I can take on a fresh start now studying for our OOP final exam and get a head 
start with little stress on my final graphics project.

## What will you do next week?
Study up on potential graphics final project options and find partners for that assignment. I also will be studying for 
OOP so that I can relax during Thanksgiving break. I'll also be getting ready for graduation, picking up my gown and cords!

## Tip of the Week
Recently at work, I needed to write a script to make what I was doing easier. I chose C++ as my script language simply because
it was what I was comfortable with and had been using a lot. It turns out, I should have thought about the implications
of choosing C++ more and came up with a more solid reason for choosing it. 
It wasn't that C++ was bad necessarily, but what I was doing (can't say much about it here, have to stay
general, sorry!) wouldn't need the control that C++ provides. Using a language such as C# would have been much easier and 
friendly with other the technologies necessary for what I was doing. In fact, a C# script had already been written to do
part of the work I needed done due to its ease of use!
Despite the vagueness of my story, I hope it's clear that it is important to put more than a passing thought like, "this is 
what I'm comfotable with and using now" when developing a useful tool for yourself and potentially others. It's important to consider
how your script will work with other existing code and remember the entire scope of your task when deciding a language.
